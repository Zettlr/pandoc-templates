  A simple cover letter template for applications.
instructions: |
  This template allows you to typeset cover letters for applications. It is
  intended to be run simply by writing the main body of the cover letter in a
  Markdown file and provide some metadata, including addresses, as YAML
  frontmatter variables. You have the following variables available:

  * `author`: An object with information about yourself. It must contain the
    following keys:
    * `firstname`: Your firstname, and potential middle names
    * `lastname`: Your last, or family name
    * `address`: This is a list of address lines. These appear on the top-right.
    * `email`: Your email address. Appears below the address.
    * `phone`: Your phone number. Appears below the address.
  * `subject`: This is the subject line of the cover letter. Appears between
    addressée and the main body of your letter.
  * `to_address`: This is a list of address lines to where you are addressing
    the letter.
  * `attachments`: If you have attachments to your application (such as a CV),
    and want to include them on your letter, list them here.
  * `attachments_title`: By default, the attachment section will be headed by
    "Attachments". Here you can customize this (e.g., by translating).
  
  Note that you also have some of the standard Pandoc variables such as
  `fontsize` available to use in your frontmatter, too.
